npm-multiuser(1) -- Set up npm in multiuser mode
================================================

## SYNOPSIS

    sudo npm multiuser

## DESCRIPTION

This command can be used to set up a globally-installed npm
to run in multi-user mode, by putting node modules, executables,
and man pages in users' home directories, so as to avoid the use
of sudo with untrusted code.

It will ask you to enter values for the various configuration
options, and then save those to the global config.

Follow the instructions on the screen.
